<p>The <b>octopus </b> is a marine mollusk and a member of the class <mark>Cephalopoda,</mark> more commonly called cephalopods. <em> Cephalopoda means “head foot” in Greek, and in this class of organisms, the head and feet are merged. A ring of eight equally-long arms surround the head.</em> They use their arms to "walk" on seafloor. The undersides of the arms are covered with suction cups that are very sensitive to touch and taste. The sack-like body is perched atop the head, which has two complex and sensitive eyes, while the mouth is on the underside. Octopuses <del>cow</del> have a hard beak, which they use to pierce the shells of crustacean prey. </P>
